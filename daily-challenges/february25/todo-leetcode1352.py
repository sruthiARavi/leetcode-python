 # 1352. Product of the Last K Numbers
 # Design an algorithm that accepts a stream of integers and retrieves the product of the last k integers of the stream.
 # Implement the ProductOfNumbers class:
   ## ProductOfNumbers() Initializes the object with an empty stream.
   ## void add(int num) Appends the integer num to the stream.
   ## int getProduct(int k) Returns the product of the last k numbers in the current list. 
   ## You can assume that always the current list has at least k numbers.
 # The test cases are generated so that, at any time, 
 # the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.
